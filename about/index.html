  <h1>About CANCANKERN</h1>

  <p>
    CANCANKERN is a daily civic organism built and operated by Casey Canfield.
    The mission is simple: turn trash into town aid, and build a model of
    community care that any city can adopt.
  </p>

  <p>
    The organism documents every action — pickups, checks, conversations,
    conditions — and publishes them through the Dashboard and DOI Archive
    for full public transparency.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work is rooted in dignity, humility, and daily practice.
