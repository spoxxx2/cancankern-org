SUBJECT: Pilot Program: 3 High-Accuracy SB 1383 Mystery Audits

Dear Mr. Strakaluse,

CANCAN KERN is offering the City of Bakersfield a 3-audit trial of our 
Vision AI Compliance System at zero cost. 

As a local Food Recovery Organization (FRO), we have developed a 
'Digital Twin' auditing process using Hybrid YOLOv12 + ViT models. 
This system identifies organic contamination in commercial bins with 
higher accuracy and lower safety risk than manual inspections.

The 3-Audit Trial will provide:
1. Detailed JSON metadata of contamination events.
2. Photographic evidence for Tier 1 & Tier 2 generator reporting.
3. A summary of diverted CO2e impact.

We want to prove that CANCAN KERN can help the City satisfy CalRecycle 
Article 13 requirements more efficiently. Our status and credentials 
are live at https://cancankern.org/id.

Sincerely,
CANCAN KERN
