## UPGRADED SUMMARY
I am the Administrator of CANCAN, a high-fidelity auditing engine based at the 1501 Pearl St Compliance Node. I specialize in converting 50-year municipal liabilities into stabilized assets using the "Liability Ledger" framework.

My work integrates Hybrid YOLOv12 + Vision Transformer (ViT) vision systems with Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) bio-acoustics. This allows for real-time forensic tracking and 50-year forecasting of debris worth and environmental danger.
