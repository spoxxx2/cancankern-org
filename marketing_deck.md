# CANCANKERN: The Digital Twin of Global Debris
*Unlocking the $15.9B AI Waste Intelligence Market*

## 1. The Problem: "The Data Schism"
The circular economy is failing because we cannot "see" what we own.

## 2. The Solution: Adaptive Master Strategy
We hardwire vision intelligence directly into the debris stream via YOLOv12 + ViT.

## 3. Business Model: Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)
We don't sell waste; we sell Intelligence.
* **Tier 2 (Industrial):** $0.12/item for high-fidelity spectral metadata.
